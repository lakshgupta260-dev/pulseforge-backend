"""
Seed script for demo/judging purposes (PS1 section 7.2).

Generates:
  - 40 mock participants with diverse skills, orgs, genders, regions
  - 20 teams (2 participants each)
  - 12 mock projects with varied tech stacks and descriptions
  - 8 mock reviewers with different expertise areas (some sharing an
    organization with a team, to exercise conflict-of-interest detection)
  - Evaluations with INTENTIONAL bias patterns baked in (one harsh
    reviewer, one lenient reviewer, and a deliberate score gap between
    two organizations) so the bias-detection feature has something real
    to find during a live demo.

Run with: python -m scripts.seed_data
