"""
Reviewer Assignment Intelligence (PS1 section 4.4 / 6.2)

Implements a multi-objective greedy assignment algorithm that balances:
  - Expertise match (40%): overlap between reviewer expertise tags and
    project tech-stack / description skill tags (NLP-normalized via the
    same skill taxonomy used for participant skill extraction).
  - Workload balance (30%): prefers reviewers further from their max
    workload, so assignments don't pile onto a few people.
  - Conflict avoidance (20%): same-organization conflicts are detected
    and heavily penalized (modeling "graph theory for conflict detection"
    from the hint -- the conflict relationship is the edge; here it's a
    simple shared-organization rule, extensible to co-authorship etc).
  - Diversity promotion (10%): mild bonus for spreading projects across
    reviewers who haven't already reviewed something from the same team.

This is a greedy multi-objective optimizer rather than a global solver
(e.g. linear assignment / Hungarian algorithm) -- chosen deliberately for
a 24-48h build: it is O(projects * reviewers), fully deterministic,
explainable (every assignment stores its score breakdown), and fast
enough to comfortably clear the "<60 seconds for 100+ projects" target
in section 6.2. A global optimum (Hungarian algorithm) is noted as a
future-work upgrade in the README.
